    "In the code chunks above, we have implemented different ideas from the MTH 496 Senior Thesis research project. We set up functions that chose distict and random values within an interval defined by the player. Moreover, we set up a function to test whether the two numbers are within an interval that is set by the player. We can think of the initial interval as a set $S$, from the respond function. Additionally, the test function tests to see how many numbers are in a set $Q$ which is a subset of $S$. Next, we implement the proven optimal strategy for this game as defined by the MTH 496 research. Here, we take a given set size and return $K(n)$ which defined the optimal number of guesses it should take for the Questioner to determine at least one of the Responder's secret numbers. This function was then used in our scoring. This scoring function took input parameters of the number of guesses the Questioner has, the initial set size $|S| = n$, the player's current score, and whether or not they guessed correctly. If they did guess correctly, then they will be rewarded points based on how efficiently they found one of the Responder's secret numbers. We elected to give them points only if they ask less than the optimal number of questions plus 1. Additionally, the player recieves more points if they answer faster than expected. For example, if they immediately guess a number and are correct, they will recieve more points than if they employ an optimal strategy to solve this game. However, this is risky as they will recieve 0 points if they guess incorrectly. "
